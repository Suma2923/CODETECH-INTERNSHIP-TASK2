Overview of the project:



Project Name: PREDICTIVE MODELLING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION

Objective:The objective of the task Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression is to develop a mathematical model that can predict the value of a dependent (target) variable based on one or more independent (predictor) variables. Linear regression aims to establish a linear relationship between the target variable and the predictor variables by fitting a line (in simple linear regression) or a hyperplane (in multiple linear regression) that best describes the relationship between them.



Key Objectives:

1.Prepare Data

2.Split Data (into training and testing sets)

3.Train Model (using linear regression)

4.Evaluate Model (using metrics like MSE and R-squared)

5.Visualize Results (using plots)

6.Interpret Model (understand the results and make decisions)





Technologies Used:

1.Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

2.NumPy: For numerical operations and handling arrays.

3.Scikit-learn: For machine learning, including linear regression models and evaluation metrics.

4.Statsmodels: For statistical modeling and linear regression analysis.

5.Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

6.Seaborn: For statistical data visualization, built on top of Matplotlib.





Key Insights:

1.Understanding the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.

2.Measuring the model's accuracy and performance using metrics like MSE and R-squared.

3.Identifying any outliers or anomalies in the data.

4.Evaluating the assumptions of linear regression, such as linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality.

5.Making predictions based on the model and using it for decision making.

6.Identifying areas for improvement and further exploration.
